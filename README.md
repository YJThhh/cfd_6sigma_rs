# cfd_6sigma_rs
*Results summariser and compariser of different simulations for 6 Sigma Data Centre Room CFD software.*

**Overview:**
Working with result files for different computational fluid dynamics files can be time consuming,
when you want to compare the results and see the best approach for the configuration for datahall and its cooling.
The tool takes in XML files (with servers as rows) spit out of the 6 Sigma CFD (Room) application, processes them for easy comparision of different simulations
Results can also be exported to CSV and displayed on chart.

Written in Python + tkinter.
